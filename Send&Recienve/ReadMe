Define the Token: First, you need to define the token that you want to send to the wallet address. You can create a new token or use an existing token. To create a new token, you need to define its name, symbol, and the number of decimals.

Define the Payment: Define the payment that the smart contract should receive before sending the tokens to the wallet address. You can define the payment in ETH or any other cryptocurrency.

Define the Smart Contract: Create a new Solidity contract that will handle the payment and token transfer.

Define the Token Interface: You need to define the interface for the ERC20 token that you want to use. You can create a new file IERC20.sol 

Deploy the Smart Contract: Deploy the smart contract on the blockchain of your choice. You will need to specify the token address and payment amount as constructor arguments.

Test the Smart Contract: To test the smart contract, send the payment amount to the smart contract address. If the payment is correct, the smart contract will send the tokens to the wallet address that made the payment.
